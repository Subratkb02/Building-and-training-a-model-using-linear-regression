# Building and Training a Model Using Linear Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the process of building and training a linear regression model.

## Overview

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used for predictive analysis. This project involves:
- Data preprocessing
- Model building
- Model training
- Performance evaluation

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of car mileage data, which is used to predict various outcomes based on input features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Installation
